# Diabetes Predictor using SVM

This project is a machine learning-based solution that predicts whether a person has diabetes or not using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The model is trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset and uses `StandardScaler` for feature standardization to improve prediction accuracy.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features

- Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
- Data preprocessing with StandardScaler
- Trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Collab
